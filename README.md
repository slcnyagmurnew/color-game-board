Using Backtracking Programming Approach

The same N colors are located in a different order in each row on the game board, which looks like an NxN matrix. The order of the colors in a row can be changed by shifting the colors to the right. For example, if the colors in the row are red, blue, green, purple, then the row is shifted to the right once, and the new order becomes purple, red, blue, green. If it is moved to the right one more time, green, purple, red and blue will be obtained. Design the algorithm that recursively arranges the rows with backtracking method so that there is only 1 of each color in each column in the result matrix.
